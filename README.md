<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

Installing the checkout-flow package is easy and straightforward. If you're using npm, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm i @jstemplate/checkout-flow
```

If you're using yarn, the command will be:

```sh
yarn add @jstemplate/checkout-flow
```

That's it! The package will now be installed and ready for use in your project. You can then import the package and use its components in your code. Please make sure that you have latest version of npm or yarn installed in your system."

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Once the checkout-flow package is installed, you can start using it in your project. Here is an example of how to import the CheckOut component and use it in your code:

```jsx
import { CheckOut } from "@jstemplate/checkout-flow";

function YourComponent() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [summaryData, setSummaryData] = useState({});
  const [cartData, setCartData] = useState([]);
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState({});
  const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    // handle form submit
  };

  return (
    <CheckOut
      loading={loading}
      formSubmit={onSubmit}
      summeryData={summaryData}
      cartData={cartData}
      userData={userData}
      autoFill
      userLogin={loggedIn}
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, we import the CheckOut component from the checkout-flow package and use it in a functional component. We also set up some state variables to be passed as props to the CheckOut component. The loading prop is used to display a loading spinner while the form is being submitted, the formSubmit prop is a callback function to handle the form submission, the summeryData, cartData, and userData props are used to display the order summary, cart items, and user information respectively, the autoFill prop is used to automatically fill the form fields if the user is logged in, the userLogin prop is used to check the user login status.
Please make sure that you have the necessary data to pass to the component as props.
